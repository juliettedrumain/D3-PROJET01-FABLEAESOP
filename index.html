    <h2> The Fox & the Grapes</h2>
<div class="main-content">
    <p> A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it.
    <p> The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more.</p>
    <p> Again and again he tried, but in vain.Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.
    <p><span class="emphasised">"What a fool I am," he said.</span> </p>
    <p><span class="emphasised">"Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for." </span> And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>

  <h2>The Wolf & the Crane</h2>
<div class="main-content">
  <p>A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.</p>
  <p>"<span class="emphasised">I will reward you very handsomely,"</span> said the Wolf, <span class="emphasised">"if you pull that bone out for me."</span> </P>
  <p>The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do. When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.</p>
  <p> <span class="emphasised">"But what about my reward!" called the Crane anxiously.</span> </p>
  <p><span class="emphasised">"What!"</span> snarled the Wolf, whirling around. <span class="emphasised">"Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?"</span> </p>

    <h2>The Eagle & the Beetle</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
    <p>A Beetle once begged the Eagle to spare a Hare which had run to her for protection. But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at the disrespect shown her, the Beetle flew to the Eagle's nest and rolled out the eggs. Not one did she spare. The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.</p>
    <p>Next year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.</p>
    <p>Now the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground. For so Jupiter commanded.</p>
